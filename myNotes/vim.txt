Search
	search within a buffer:
	To search for instances of a regex within a buffer:
		/<pattern><CR>
		To go the second match, either
			/<CR>   or   n    or N (backward)
		To search backwards:
			?<pattern><CR>
		can configure vim to wrap the search around from the end 
				of the buffer back to the start:
			:set wrapscan	
	To search for world under cursor: * , # (backward)
	g* - Word under cursor -forward (unbounded)
	==============================
	search within a line:
	Often you just want to jump to a particular character 
			within the current line
	There's some short-cuts for that: 
		f<char> (for "find")
		F<char> (for "find backward")
		t<char> (for "till")
		T<cahr> (for "till backward")
	if you put a count before the f you're jumped to the Nth instance:
		5fu
	use ";", "," for repeat

word motions:
	w  - Forward to the beginning of next word
	W  - Forvard to the beginning of the next WORD
	b  - Backward to the next beginning of a word
	B  - Backward to the next beginning of a WORD
	e  - Forward to the next end of word
	ge - Backward to the end of the previous word
	E  - Forward to the next end of WORD
		
	( '.' is a word but not is a WORD)
	sample : press w or W below 
		hello! word

============================================================
line and paragragh motions:
	0	- To move to the start of the current line
	^	- To move to the start of the first word of the current line
	$	- To move to the end of the current line
	<CR>- To move to the start of the next line
	-	- To move to the start of the previous line
	{	- To move to the start of the current paragraph
	}	- to move to the end of the current paragraph
	gg	- to move to the top of the buffer
	G	- to move to the end of the buffer
	ngg - to move to line n (:n and nG work same)
	
	A paragraph is delimited by empty lines (not black lines)

set:
	relativenumber
	number
	tabstop
	shiftwidth
	hlsearch
	wildmenu
	showmode:
		show the mode that you are in
	showcmd:
		show the partial commands as you type them
	matchpairs+=<:>
	ruler:
		show the line and column number of the cursor 
		for the column if there are tab show two number
			first tab counted one and second tab counted four
		TODO : help rulerformat
			   help statusline
	wrapscan:
		can configure vim to wrap the search around from the 
			end of the buffer back to the start
		default is set so can set nowrapscan for no wrapping

============================================================
Repeat yourself numerically
	if you prefix any of the preceding commands with a number, 
		it is repeated that many times:	
		2oplease!<ESC>
			please!
			please!
	you can also repeat the most recent editing command  with: .
	For example, the erlier begging could also achieved with:
		oPlease!<ESC>
		.....
	advantage : you can simply stop when you have enougth
		rather than having to guesstimate many beforehand

============================================================
keep track of where you are
	<CTRL_G>  - where you are
	g<CTRL_G> - more precisely where you are

	for enable the ruler:
		:set ruler

============================================================
matching delimiters
	%	- to move the matching bracket of a {...}, (...) or [...] pair
	by default, vim only matches [], (), [] but you can extend that 
			to whatever pairs you like:
		set matchpairs+=<:>

============================================================
pen to the page:
	i - Enter insert mode at cursor
	I - Enter insert mode at first non-blank character
	s - Delete character under cursor and enter insert mode
		5s : remove 5 character and enter insert mode
	S - Delete line and begin insert at beginning of same line
	a - Enter insert mode at _after_ curso
	A - Enter insert mode at the end of the line
	o - Enter insert mode on the next line
	O - Enter insert mode on the above line
	c - replace from the current cursor position to where 
		the motion reaches
	C - Delete from cursor to end of line and begin insert

============================================================
Control your insertions
	In either editing mode most characters you type insert 
		that character...but not all!
	Many of the control characters have special insertion begaviours
	CTRL-Y	duplicates the character in the same column on 
		the preceding line
	CTRL-E	duplicates the character in the same column on 
		the following line
	CTRL-A	insert again whatever the most-recent inserted text was
	CTRL-R	inserts the contents of a register
	CTRL-R=	evaluates an expression and insert the result
	CTRL-T	inserts a tab at the start of the line 
		(without moving the insertion point)
	CTRL-V	inserts the next character verbatim
		(even if it's normally a control character)
	CTRL-W	deletes the word preceding the cursor
	CTRL-O	takes you back to Normal mode for one command
		Handy, for example, to clean the rest of the line: D

============================================================
Keep track of where you were
	In normal mode, you can leave a mark at any cursor position
	just tyme m<char>
	for example
		mh
	then to go back to that mark you type a backquote :
		`<same char>
	or to go to start of the line containing the mark :
		'<same char>
	if fou use a lowercase letter, the mark is per-buffer
	if you use an uppercase letter, the mark is global
	For example:
		mQ
		:edit some_other_file<CR>
		`Q
	you see all the marks you've set by typing :marks	

============================================================
Editing with marks
	one of the most important uses of marks
	As a "motion" for other editing commands
	for any command that takes a motion after it...
		such as c, d, y, >, etc
		you can use a jump-to-mark motion as well
		for example to delete several hundred lines of code...
			move to the start of the code
			set a "start" mark: ms
			move to the end of the code
			delete back to the "start" mark: d`s

============================================================
use vim's own navigation marks
	vim sets certain non-alphabetic marks automatically :
	`` - takes you to the last place you *jumped from	
	A handy trick when working on two regions of a file :
		set the context mark at the first region: m`
		jump to the second region
		then `` between the two region	
	Another handy "Where was I?" mark is `"
	This is where you were last time you exited the current file
	Vim also keeps a list of all your jumps within a file
	You can use <CTRL-O> and <CTRL-I> to 
		step back and forth through the list
	
	(*jumped where "jumped" means searched, used G, or 
		returned to a mark)

============================================================
Navigate between lowercase marks
	['	jump to previous line with a lowercase mark
	]'	jump to next line with a lowercase mark
	[`	jump to previous lowercase mark
	]`	jump to next lowercase mark
		* The above commands take a count. For example, 5]`

============================================================
Special marks
	vim has some special marks which it sets automatically
	`.	jump to position where last change occurred in current buffer
	`"	jump to position where last exited current buffer
	`0	jump to position in last file edited (when exited vim)	
	`1	line `0 but the previous file (also `2 etc)
	''	jump back (to line in current buffer where jumped from)
	``	jump back (to position in current buffer where jumped from)	
	`[ 	jump to beginning of previously changed or yanked text
	`] 	jump to    end    of previously changed or yanked text
	`<	jump to beginning of last visual selection
	`>	jump to    end    of last visual selection
	`^	jump to the position where the cursor was the last time when
			Insert mode was stopped
